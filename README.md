## Tips & Notes

- There is a secret keybind to jump to known stations/noises.

- Strange Noise channels never appear in FM mode.

- The knob only turns with mouse dragâ€”no keyboard tuning.

- Step size controls tuning speed and precision.

- Some sounds may fade in or fade out between different channels.

Strange noises are always an owl's 'hoot'.
